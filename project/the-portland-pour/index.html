  </p>
  <p>The Portland Pour was a blog that became many things. It was about beverage photography, product photography, cocktail recipes, technique, and history. It was a writing project, an art project, a lead generation project, and a technical project.</p>
<p>In 2016 a fellow artist who, as chance had it, was also a bartender, suggested she could pour drinks if I wanted to photograph them. She explained that Bars needed photos for their menus, distillers and producers needed product photography, and I needed a new project. So, with a need for new clients, we started building our portfolio.</p>
<p>I photographed the cocktails in my creative style and, when we had enough, started working on a blog. What could set us apart? Local spirits. The Portland Pour was about locally distilled spirits and the drinks you could make with them.</p>
<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>There's nothing wrong with WordPress, but I wanted a headless blog and a React front end. So for the blog, I chose Ghost and installed it on my server. Ghost has a nice, simple API and is a usable writing platform.</p>
<p>The front end would be React with some MUI component library goodness. It came together quickly, and I worked through several designs. Once up and running, I added search (Ghost, strangely, has no search functionality) using Google APIs and got to work on server-side rendering.</p>
<p>A blog is nothing if there is no SEO, and React may be great at many things, but at SEO, it is not. The solution was to build a small Express app that rendered the first view on the server, then let the client do the rest.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>We kept making pictures of cocktails, then decided we should publish them with recipes. Those recipes became blog posts about cocktails' history and their cultural context. Like a food blog, I assumed that nobody was interested in the writing and just wanted the recipes, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>Since one of the project's goals was lead generation, we added feature posts about local industry companies and people. Before long, we worked for some of the local companies, which got us clients from other cities and states.</p>
<p>However, to our surprise, none of our readers understood the concept of &quot;local.&quot; In Portland, Oregon, few got the whole &quot;shop local&quot; aspect of The Portland Pour. We kept trying, though and would run feature campaigns to raise awareness of local distilling.</p>
<p>The good folks at Bull Run Distilling joined us for a Drink Local campaign, and I got to work with companies like Eastside Distilling and Trail Distilling, who would offer us recipe ideas for their products and many others. For some, we did product photography, and others have my work in their tasting rooms. Occasionally, we'd be asked to create cocktails for a specific brand or product.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>The project is now archived, it served its purpose, and there are only so many cocktails in which anyone is interested. The writing was evolving, my clients were becoming diverse, and I had a technical interest in doing more with content, design, and design systems. The application I had built had shortcomings, and I wanted to create a design system of my own so that I could spend more time on billable hours and less time on website updates.</p>
<p>My vision for a design system for The Portland Pour was of a platform agnostic, work anywhere system. Design systems at the time were coming into their own but in service to a specific technology. You could have a design system for React, a design system for Angular, and so on, but you couldn't have a design system for everything. So why not? I had worked with design systems, built plenty of component libraries, and it was just the next logical step to put it together.</p>
