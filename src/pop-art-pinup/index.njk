    <h1>Pop Art Pinup</h1>
    <p>
      For several years I published an annual calendar featuring classic pinup pictures.
      It all began when I took on the job of catalog photography for a pinup clothing designer in Portland.
      My studio was in her warehouse, which gave us access to some of the finest new and vintage fashions available.
      Pop Art Pinup became a lifestyle brand, and later grew into Mouse and Moon Creations, which saw me return to fairy tale themed stories and pictures on a much larger scale than a calendar.
      For a time, however, it was all very mid-century modern with a wink to contemporary style.
