  <p>The aging empire and rising rebellion, the reluctant hero and mysterious creature, the suffering masses, and the magical land are all well-worn tropes of literature. We often see it and read it in movies, comics, and books. It's tried and true and too often a cop-out, a lazy reach for the uninspired. In competent hands, however, it's a canvas upon which a capable storyteller weaves magic, a familiar template for the exceptional, and a recognized format that lets character and plot shine.</p>
<p>The Bone Shard Daughter, the first book in The Drowning Empire series by Andrea Stewart, is an example of the latter. Stories that span volumes are problematic in their way, and one book should be enough, but concede the codified template of Tolkien and accept that they are inevitable. At least as far as fantasy goes, The Drowning Empire is what it is. So what, exactly?</p>
<p>The central theme of The Bone Shard Daughter is identity. Stewart places her characters in an island world of her creation and gives them no help. Approaching the work is initially challenging because we don't know the characters, but neither do they. There are examples of memory loss and self-discovery that mercilessly inflict all classes of the strange world. Yet they are intertwined. We learn about the world as we learn about the characters, and we learn about the characters as we learn about the world. Yet only to a point.</p>
<p>Through immersion in this island land, we experience the discovery as the characters do. What emerges is a rich and misunderstood history populated by people we don't know if we like. Who is the hero, and who is the villain? We don't know because they don't know either. So all the ingredients for the usual clash of power and revolt exist precisely where they are supposed to be, yet we're never really sure if what we see is what is.</p>
<p>If that implies that the story is confusing or difficult, it's not. The plot moves along understandably while steadily increasing pace and suspense. We wonder along with the characters, not about them. The plot unfolds through their discovery, and, as one would expect, lines of conflict are drawn, even if in unexpected places.</p>
<p>The writing is serviceable but concise. It never becomes unendurable, yet it's not as remarkable in a clearly identifiable style as in an author of lesser storytelling ability and stronger literary voice. In The Bone Shard Daughter, that's an excellent thing indeed. Stewart gets out of the way and lets her remarkable story shine unbolstered by flowery prose.</p>
<p>The magical and fantasy elements of Stewart's world are never described. Instead, they are assumed, as one assumes the sensation of a warm breeze or the obligation of taxes. The characters know how it works (for the most part), but we don't. We learn by paying attention as one learns the cultural norms of a new place or country on their first arrival.</p>
<p>If there's a downside to this wonderful read, it's that we don't get resolution, at least not enough. Blame that on being one book in a series, but the one book in the series does what it should do. It whets our appetite for more, which is less cynical than it sounds. At least you know what your next book is going to be. As for this one, it's worth checking out.</p>
