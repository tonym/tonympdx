  <p>We live in a remarkable time when diversity and inclusion are taken seriously in the workplace. Companies are coming to grips with the inefficiency of filtering resumes based on keywords as if it's a personal brand SEO lottery designed to exclude, not include. They've begun realizing that the heartless, passive, automated rejection email is doing more to drive people away from opportunity rather than towards it. They've gone from &quot;be professional at work&quot; to &quot;be your authentic self&quot; as a path to a more diverse workforce. They've begun dealing with inequity by restricting the entitlement of some and elevating the entitlement of others in search of a fair baseline for entry and reward. Safe spaces are mandatory and defended in response to the cesspool of grab-ass hostility and harassment that infested the tech industry for too long. The underrepresented are included, heard, and valued for who they are and what they offer in what should be a renaissance of humanity among artisans. However, we are still at the beginning of the journey, and change takes time. For a great many, there is still no acceptance or safe space at too many companies, and few employers will acknowledge that people with mental illness remain on the outside looking in.</p>
<p>In the mid-2010s, I created a series of conceptual photographs called &quot;Bread and Roses.&quot; The series' theme is acknowledgment. I attempt to show not just how the world looks through the eyes of someone with a mental illness but how it feels. Of my creative work, it's among the few collections I still keep in my portfolio. It's not commercial, and there are no product or advertising pictures. It's not published, and I rarely show it. It has no business in my portfolio and likely turns some potential clients or employers away, but I keep it there for those who need to see it and know they, too, are seen.</p>
<p>I have borderline personality disorder (BPD). BPD is characterized by an intense fear of abandonment, an unstable self-image, impulsive behavior, self-harm, highly variable mood swings, and emotional dysregulation. I'm a real piece of work, yet I'm a successful artist and developer, not in spite of my illness but because of it. I'm reminded of that every time someone looks at my work and lets it speak to them.</p>
<p>In 2019 a young designer contacted me and explained their experience with BPD. They knew what it was, what it felt like, what it meant to have a family member with BPD, and what it meant to see the work and not feel alone. I don't label &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; as a depiction of BPD; it's just one of those things that if you know, you know, and if you don't, they're still nice pictures to look at. That's what art should do. Tell you something about the artist, tell you something about you, the viewer, or tell you something about both artist and viewer.</p>
<p>We've made great strides toward inclusion in the modern workplace, encouraging people to share their unique and authentic experiences. We carve out spaces for mutual support, and I love that I can be out as queer among other queer coworkers who accept that pansexuality is indeed a point of pride, especially for a man old enough to remember a time when it kinda wasn't. I love that women in tech can now be women in tech and have room to support each other. I love seeing black people among my peers. I love that all these employee resource groups can support their members on common ground and share who they are with the general company population. Neurodiversity, though, is another matter.</p>
<p>I've never had a problem being out at work or not, and it never seemed important to me. I know that is my experience and not the experience of a great many who cannot say that. My problem is having to work while sick. I'm sick all the time. A mental illness is not a cold. It's always there, it never goes away or takes a break, and the best we can do is deal with it. In my case, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). You see, in the old days, like, the nineties, BPD was considered untreatable. Most doctors refused to accept BPD patients, and those who did loaded us up on lithium and Prozac, which made us zombies. DBT changed that. BPD is now treatable, and we have the tools to recover from it. It takes formidable practice, daily work, and endless effort, but it does work. Except when it doesn't.</p>

<p>In those moments, when I try and fail, the &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; pictures become pictures for me, too. To see, on the wall, what it feels like to look into a mirror and not recognize the person there. How it feels to want to connect with someone but can't because of an overwhelming fear of rejection or to work so hard for someone who sees only personal gain and not the person behind it. A gift with consequences. The feeling of being invisible. You don't see me.</p>
<p>The migraines that never end, like your head is wrapped in wire, or the fog of dissociation when overwhelmed by sensory input and emotional confusion that... You have to stop.</p>
<p>In 2018, a young person with BPD saw my pictures for the first time and smiled. &quot;I know how that feels,&quot; they said. I smiled, too, because it's not all doom and gloom. Emotional dysregulation means we feel all the emotions, all the time, at full volume. Yes, it means we feel depression, but also great joy. We appreciate love and beauty just as intensely, and what those of us with BPD know that those without don't is that your full volume, your 10, is our 3 or 4. We drink from an emotional firehose, which makes the world a glorious place. Glorious, that is, when we are safe enough to revel in it.</p>
<p>Neurodiversity in the workplace is making strides, and we're seeing improvement in accommodation and support for a growing number of conditions. I never thought I would see anything like this in my career, yet there's still a hand on the door, and it's still only open so far. For those of us with the scary diseases, even the most accommodating workplace is still a dangerous and lonely place of microaggressions and stigma. How many times have I heard, &quot;what's wrong with you?&quot; or &quot;why can't you do this, that, or the other thing?&quot; or, the most awful and most common, &quot;you have your quirks, but you're OK.&quot; No, accommodation for neurodiversity is more often about mental health, not mental illness.</p>
<p>Think about mental health as one would consider physical health. You eat right, go to the gym and work out, avoid tobacco, limit the alcohol, and walk to work instead of driving or taking the bus. If you live with a physical disability, however, the formula changes. Health needs become more specific, and accommodation becomes more important. With mental health, you meditate, practice mindfulness, keep the mind sharp through study or some mental exercise, see a therapist when you need to, and make it a practice as part of an overall health maintenance plan. For those with mental disabilities, the same changes happen to the formula. We have more specific needs and require more active accommodation.</p>
<p>All of our needs are different, of course, and even when our needs are met, we'll have bad days. Everyone has bad days. People with mental illness experience bad days under a much more critical eye with much less leeway or understanding. Stigma. Instead, let's learn what makes a good day and work toward that. For me, I need a positive environment, strong and committed management support and a clearly defined lane in which I know exactly what's asked of me and what goal we are working towards.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/5pnyimif/production/ffc9796011b2f9ad6d73aaf68cbdaaba7ca7a7bd-640x800.jpg?w=600" alt="undefined"></p>
<p>In some companies, accommodation means adjusting the process or workflow based on an individual. More often than not, it is the manager or supervisor who takes an interest and is willing to do the work. These are the people I like, people who don't dismiss emotional limitations as shortcomings; rather, they see them as boundaries. I've worked with many excellent managers and colleagues, all of whom care about people first, acknowledge that we have unique qualities and flaws, and ensure the safety of those around them with listening and support. I've also worked with a fair share of bullies and scoundrels.</p>
<p>At the organizational level, we have to do better. Mental illness knows no boundary of race, gender, orientation, class, or age. It afflicts a percentage of all of us. It's not enough to declare inclusivity unless you are ready to do the work to make a place that is inclusive of everyone, and it's hard to do. As an employee, it took me years to learn how to set boundaries and defend them, how to walk away from dangerous places, and how to deal with an uncertain future instead of risking the regrettable outcome of a bad situation. As an employer, it was, to my cost and shame, even harder to learn. As someone with a neurodiverse condition, one would think I would have an advantage, but that's not true. I don't know any more than anyone else, and if knowing what actions to take is hard for me, how would it be for someone who doesn't walk a different path?</p>
<p>We all have to work together. It's time to start having difficult conversations about mental illness, and it's time for executives and managers to listen. We're here, we're in the workforce, and we are quite often very good at what we do when given the right conditions under which to do it. For workers, express yourself. Create your pictures, tell your stories, and be proud. You might not want to be open about yourself, and that's OK. Some of us are, and we can be for you too, which is why I keep creative work in my technical portfolio. If my creations bother or offend you, I don't care. They are not there for you, and that saves me from employers still steeped in stigma. On the other hand, if they do speak to you, I'll be glad because it's what we need to start creating positive change in workplaces and companies where we're still invisible.</p>
