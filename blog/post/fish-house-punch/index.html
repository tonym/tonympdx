  <p>Fish House Punch is older than the United States of America. Many recipes and adjustments later, it’s still a great Summer drink, or, served warm and mulled, a comforting companion on cold Winter nights. Even though punch is often served in a bowl for a crowd, there’s no rule that says you can’t mix just one glass.</p>
<p>The beverage in question originally hails from the State in Schuylkill (it’s pronounced SKOO-kuhl) Fishing Company, also known as the Fish House, in 1730s Philadelphia. The State in Schuylkill was (and is?) a weird ‘sovereign’ nation in Pennsylvania whose members call themselves ‘citizens.’ Think British East India Company, or the Hudson Bay Company. The tradition of the Fish House, however, is one of rebellion. In colonial America, the British were not popular, so colonists organized themselves in groups far from King and Crown, and were mostly left alone. Citizens of the State in Schuylkill would fish and drink punch. Of course all things came to a head because the Brits liked taxes and the future Americans didn’t.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the taxes of the Boston Tea Party that lit the fuse of revolution, although it didn’t help. The tax that first angered the colonists was the Molasses Act of 1733 in which the British placed a tax on sugar and molasses imported from non British nations because what’s made from molasses? Yes, rum. Who else was making rum? The colonists because, why buy from the English what you can make yourself? You see, the English ran their colonies, and later their empire like a gang of thugs. One of their ridiculous laws prevented colonists from buying rum from anyone but the English, and when the colonists said no, making their own rum instead, the English passed another law prohibiting the purchase of sugar and molasses from anyone but the English. That didn’t work, either, so the taxes came. Yet the colonists still kept making rum, and what’s made with rum? Lots of things, including Fish House Punch.</p>
<p>1733, some historians would argue, was a tipping point in the colonies, and the eventual result was war and independence. George Washington, as with all Americans, enjoyed a drink, and was quite fond of Fish House Punch. Oral history contends that Washington, one post revolutionary evening, raised 13 victory toasts, one for each colony, now state, and subsequently found diary entries beyond his ability for 3 days. True enough that Washington would have toasted victory, but was it hangover that kept the general from writing, or could it have been that he had just won a difficult war against the most powerful military in the world and wanted a rest? We’ll never know, but we do know Washington did, indeed, drink Fish House Punch, and we also do know that Fish House Punch is a powerful cocktail. So maybe it was a hangover after all.</p>
<p>Whatever afflictions befell the general, self inflicted or not, Fish House Punch is an exceptionally easy drink, and still popular today. We don’t often enjoy drinks with two or more base spirits, but Fish House Punch, with both rum and cognac, is a rare exception. The difference here is, not only proper selection of both rum and brandy, but the addition of peach liqueur, which acts as the unifying ingredient. The peach sort of makes everyone play nice together and it works, as America’s first president apparently found out.</p>
<p>So how do you make it? That depends on the recipe, this one comes from Death and Co., and favors Jamaican rum and cognac. Peach liqueur is the unifying ingredient and the lemon juice and soda make it more like a spiked lemonade than anything else. In the end, Fish House Punch is a cocktail (or a punch) that’s stood the test of time for almost 300 years. I think we can drink to that.</p>
<p>2 oz Cold soda<br>
3/4 oz Rum<br>
3/4 oz Cognac<br>
3/4 oz Peach liqueur<br>
3/4 oz Lemon juice<br>
1/4 oz Simple syrup<br>
1 strip Lemon peel</p>
<p>Pour the soda into a goblet or collins glass. Short shake the remaining ingredients (about a 5 second shake with ice should do) and add to the glass with the soda. Add ice, and garnish with a lemon wheel, and, optionally, fresh grated nutmeg.</p>
